# note : 
On Feb 1 and 2, [Kathmandu University Computer Club](https://github.com/kucc1997) conducted "Git & GitHub: All you need to know" workshop. This workshop was really great to understand the concept of git and github along with the common practices. Not only that, on the second day, I got to learn about opensource contribution, what and why along with demo shown Aasish(name confused !) -a second year student and talented open source contributer.
